# Intelligent Agents in the Fight against Forest Fires

### Description

The scenario chosen for this project was to combat fires with the use of airplanes.

In this scenario we have, as agents, the airplanes and the headquarters - responsible for coordinating the airplanes, and, as an environment, the fires and the water supply stations (rivers, seas, lagoons, ...). Airplanes would have limited supply capacity.

We used RapidMiner for the second part of the project in order to predict the time it takes to put out fire given the number of fires and various characteristics of the environment.

### Examples of dependent variables:

+ Number of airplanes available;
+ Waiting time required for each airplane;
+ Resource allocation;

### Examples of independent variables:

+ Quantity / size of each fire;
+ Number of fires in itself;
+ Criteria for allocation of airplanes by fires;
+ Quantity of supplies / resources available;
+ Characteristics of each airplane;

### Technologies/Tools and Languages
